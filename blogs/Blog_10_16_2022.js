                Ever since graduation I haven't written that much and this blog is a meant to remedy that. 
                I am not sure exactly what I'll write about but I'll try my best to keep it interesting. 
       
          
            Towards that endeavor, the background image will help to lay out the blog's <i>shakal</i>:     </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://oart.eu/melody">
            When playing a piece of instrumental music on the rubab it is customary to begin with a slow introduction in free rhythm that reveals the melodic characteristics of the mode to be played. Such an introduction
              is called a shakl, meaning 'face' or 'features'. It corresponds approximately to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alap" target="_blank">alap</a> of North Indian music, or the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taqsim">taqsim</a>  of Middle Eastern music.

            The particular picture above image reminds me of the drive on the way back from Swat Valley through the Malakand, another pass a few miles west. Besides their scenic beauty, 
            the passes are famous for the historical defense the Yousafzai Pashtuns put up against invaders ever since first occupying Swat Valley under Malak Ahmad Khan Yusufzai (1460–1530).

            </p>
            
            <p>I'll briefly narrate one such battle that was mentioned in the caption of this image.
In 1586, the famed Mughal Emperor Akbar lost 8000 soldiers and the main commander of the Mughal army, Raja Birbal, at the Karakar Pass in an attempt 
            to subdue the Yousafzai Pashtuns.       </p>

            <blockquote>
        The Mughal army forced the submission of many Yusufzai chiefs in Swat and Bajaur. But a relief force on its way to Swat through the difficult mountain terrain met disaster. Split command between a royal favorite, Raja Bir Bar, the court wit, and Zain Khan Koka, an ordinary field general, weakened the usually careful deployment of Akbar's armies. A reckless attack on the Yusufzais exposed the royal army to ambush in the mountain passes. About 8,000 imperial soldiers, including Raja Bir Bar, were killed in the greatest disaster to Mughal arms in Akbar's reign.

            <p>The pass was subsequently visited by the British during their colonial campaigns. Winston Churchill, the bigot, 
            writes of the British troops upon reaching Mingora: </p>
            <blockquote>
        
                On the 21st a reconnaissance as far as the Kotke Pass afforded much valuable information as to the nature of the country. <br></br><br></br>
            All were struck with the beauty of the scenery, and when on the 24th the force marched back
                 to Barikot, they carried away with them the memory of a beautiful valley, where the green
                  of the rice fields was separated from the blue of the sky by the glittering snow peaks 
                  of the Himalayas.<br></br><br></br>


While the troops rested at Barikot, Sir Bindon Blood personally reconnoitred the Karakar Pass, which 
    leads from the Swat Valley into the country of the Bunerwals.
Telegrams were despatched to India on the subject, and after much delay and hesitation the Viceroy decided against the recommendation of his victorious general.

<p>
After several battles, the British would settle on creating a buffer zone towards the north of Malakand by entering 
into alliances with the Princely States of Swat & Dir.</p>

<p> The Princely States were later absorbed into Pakistan in 1947 leading to a <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2078824/across-religious-divides-harmonious-haven-hindus-khyber-pakhtunkhwa" target="_blank">mass exodus of the sizeable local Hindu population</a>. I remember my grandmother narrating how their Hindu neighbors in a rush to leave left behind all their belongings (which were looted by locals) and buried their jewellery (still being unearthed) in the hopes to reclaim it one day.
 Another more recent mass displacement of the residents of the valley occured during the Second Battle of Swat in 2009 when the 2 million local population of Swat were internally displaced for military operations against the TTP.

            <p> I'll leave it to you to dig deeper into the history of the Yusufzai but I hope images like these can set the back drop for our conversation. 
                Besides this innovation, there won't be any strict format or theme. I'll be very happy if I end up sharing with you some of the things that I find interesting.

               <p> Finally, as gratitude to my alma mater for helping illuminate most of
                 the topics I'll discuss in this blog, I'll end this welcome with UC Berkeley's motto: </p>
