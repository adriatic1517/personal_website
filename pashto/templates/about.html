			<p>Hello.</p>


			<p>This is a Pashto to English dictionary written about 200 years ago and digitized by the University of Chicago's Digital Dictionaries of South Asia project.</p>

			<p>This is the beginning of what I hope to be a broader project of digitizing Pashto language and literature.</p>

			<p>Some features that this project adds on are a very fast, scalable search algorithm, responsive interface and accessibility to the general public. 
			</p>

			<p>I created it with the help of <a href="kind_people">these</a> kind people.</p>

			<p> If you would like to know more about this project, read my <a href = "#">blog post </a>(coming soon) on it. </p>
