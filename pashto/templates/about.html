			<p>Hello.</p>

			<p>This is one of the few dictionaries of Pashto in digital form.</p>

			<p>I created it with the help of <a href="#">these</a> kind people.</p>

			<p>This is the beginning of what I hope to be a broader project of digitizing literature in the Persio-Arabic script.</p>

			<p> I hope that sometime in the future, Pashto literature is accessible and Pashto can be learnt online</p>

			<p> I present this in its current form, in the hopes that perhaps it might be useful to someone.</p>

			<p> If you would like to know more about this project or are interested in the technical aspects, read my <a href = "#">blog post </a> on it. </p>
