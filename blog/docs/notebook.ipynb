That's so many lifetimes of so much math but not even a single calculator besides like abascus and other mechanical stuff. In fact, algorithms themselves have been explored since time immemorial. \n",

Al-Khwarizmi laid out the methods for adding, multiplying, dividing, extracting square roots and even calculating the digits of $\\pi$. As they put it \"These procedures, were precise, unambigous, mechanial, efficient, correct - in short, they were algorithms, a term coined to honor the wise man, after the decimal system was finally adopted in Europe, many centuries later.\"\n",
